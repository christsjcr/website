        <h2>üìú Constitution</h2>
        <p>
            The JCR is guided by a Constitution which dictates the composition
            of the Executive Committee and the responsibilities of its officers
            to Christ's students. It also governs more mundane procedural
            matters and the nature of the relationship between the JCR and the
            College. Although wordy and a little dry in places, the Constitution
            is a crucial document which enshrines the rights of all Christ's
            students and ensures that the JCR Exec is held accountable for its
            actions. It is regularly updated and often undergoes major revisions
            to suit the changing needs of the Christ's student body.

        <h2>üí∏ Financial Conduct & Procedure</h2>
        <p>
            This document specifies how the JCR handles its finances. It
            outlines how the annual budget is made, and explains the oversight
            role of the "CCSU Finance Committee". Although primarily useful as a
            'how-to' guide for the JCR Treasurer, it also includes technical
            obligations for clubs handling revenue, for example. It obliges the
            JCR Exec to maintain financial transparency for all students by
            publishing and distributing termly expenditure reports.
        </p>
        <p>
            The JCR has to conform to this document, so it's accessible here for
            all students to read!

        <h2>‚õπÔ∏è Society Funding Guidelines</h2>
        <p>
            Christ's JCR funds sports clubs and non-sports clubs in accordance
            with their integral functions. Funding requests from clubs are
            graded as "high priority", "medium priority", "low priority", or
            "refused", in an equitable and uniform way. The following guidelines
            specify how to grade different funding requests, and thereby create
            a fair overall budget.
