            The JCR is guided by a Constitution which dictates the composition
            of the Executive Committee and the responsibilities of its officers
            to Christ's students. It also governs more mundane procedural
            matters and the nature of the relationship between the JCR and the
            College. Although wordy and a little dry in places, the Constitution
            is a crucial document which enshrines the rights of all Christ's
            students and ensures that the JCR Exec is held accountable for its
            actions. It is regularly updated and often undergoes major revisions
            to suit the changing needs of the Christ's student body.
