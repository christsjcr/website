            <p>
                In the summer of 2021, four Christ's students worked for a month
                as paid interns, researching the complex connections of College
                members with the transatlantic slave trade, the legacies of
                enslavement and the movement for abolition. Their work,
                facilitated by the College Archivist Dr Genny Silvanus, was
                intended to complement the Vice-Chancellor's initiative at the
                University level. The four students presented their work to an
                open meeting in the Lloyd Room on 21 October and also through an
                exhibition in the Old Library for two weeks from 28 October.
            </p>

                College Council has approved a follow-up project for 2022,
                building on last year. Up to four students will be awarded
                grants to work for up to four weeks (11 July - 5 August). The
                project will be coordinated by Prof. David Reynolds and Dr
                Harriet Lyon. Dr Silvanus will offer advice on databases,
                archives etc.

            <p>
                The initial task this year will be to construct
                <b>the fullest possible database of College members</b>
                involved in the slave trade, slave plantations and the anti-slavery
                movement. This will exploit the substantial electronic resources
                available, e.g. the
                <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/" target="_blank"
                    >Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slavery</a
                >
                and a
                <a href="https://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/"
                    >Cambridge Alumni Database</a
                >. It will also identify links with particular Caribbean islands
                and British port cities, of which the most significant were
                Bristol, Liverpool and Glasgow. The research will plug into many
                lively community projects now developing across Britain, e.g.
                <a
                    href="https://www.lancasterslaveryfamilytrees.com/"
                    target="_blank">Lancaster Slavery Family Trees</a
                >.
            </p>

            <p>
                Depending on progress with the database, in the later phase of
                this summer's project there should be time to research more
                closely at some key individuals identified last summer (see note
                below). This is likely to entail <b
                    >some research in archives elsewhere in Britain</b
                >, especially Bristol and London.
            </p>

            <p>
                The students' research will result in various public outputs,
                depending on the nature of their work. As well as the database
                and individual reports, these could include blogs, websites,
                articles for Pieces/ College magazine - and another exhibition,
                if there were sufficient visual content of quality.

                <b>There will be a Zoom meeting on Friday 29 April, 5pm</b>, to
